# Part D: Evaluate

## User Acceptance Testing
- Users (peers and teacher) performed acceptance testing using a structured checklist covering all features: product management, storage/retrieval, search, and visualization.
- All critical workflows were tested for correctness, usability, and error handling.

## Questionnaire Data
| Question | Response Summary |
|----------|-----------------|

| Did all features work as expected? | Yes, all core features functioned correctly with the provided test data. |
| Was the warehouse visualization clear? | Yes, the 2D grid was easy to interpret. |
| Suggestions for improvement? | Add GUI, export reports, more advanced search. |

## Developer Retrospective
- **Successes:**
    - OOP design made the system modular and easy to extend.
    - 2D visualization provided clear insight into inventory distribution.
    - Robust validation and error handling prevented data issues.
- **Challenges:**
    - Ensuring data consistency between product quantities and warehouse locations.
    - Handling edge cases in storage/retrieval (e.g., overfilling locations).
- **Future Improvements:**
    - Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for broader accessibility.
    - Implement advanced analytics and reporting features.
    - Enhance automated testing and CI/CD integration.
