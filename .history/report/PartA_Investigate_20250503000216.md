# Part A: Investigate

## Program Description

For this project, I set out to build an Inventory Management System that uses a 2D array to visualize a warehouse. I wanted to make something that would actually help me (or anyone else) keep track of products, where they're stored, and how much stock is available. I wrote the system in Python and made sure it had a graphical user interface (GUI) that would be intuitive and easy to use.

The main idea is that every product has a name, SKU, price, and quantity, and every location in the warehouse is represented as a cell in a grid. I can add, edit, and remove products, and then store or retrieve them from specific locations. The GUI makes it easy to see the whole warehouse at a glance, allowing users to quickly identify which areas are full, empty, or partially filled.

## Requirements

Hereâ€™s what I needed my system to do (and what I actually implemented):

- Let me add, edit, and remove products, each with a name, SKU, price, and quantity.
- Store and retrieve products in specific warehouse locations, each with a set capacity.
- Show the warehouse as a 2D grid, so I can see which locations are full, empty, or partially filled.
- Provide a GUI (for visual management) with an intuitive interface making it easy to visualize the warehouse layout and perform all inventory operations.
- Save and load all product and location data using CSV files, so nothing is lost between sessions.
- Log all user actions for traceability (e.g., adding products, storing, retrieving).
- Validate all user input and handle errors gracefully (like trying to store too many items in one location).
- Use Git for version control, with clear commit messages and branches for different features.

## Gantt Chart

I carefully planned my development schedule over five weeks, breaking down each feature and component to ensure timely completion:

The detailed breakdown helped me track progress and ensure each component received appropriate attention throughout the development lifecycle.

## How OOP Helped My Design

I implemented object-oriented programming (OOP) principles throughout the project, which significantly improved the organization, maintainability, and extensibility of my code:

- **Encapsulation:** Each class encapsulates its data and behavior, hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary interfaces:
  ```python
  # Product class encapsulates product data and operations
  class Product:
      def __init__(self, name, sku, price, quantity=0, warehouse=None):
          self.name = name
          self.sku = sku
          self.price = price
          self.quantity = quantity
      
      def update_quantity(self, amount):
          if self.quantity + amount < 0:
              return False
          self.quantity += amount
          return True
  ```

- **Inheritance:** While I haven't implemented subclasses yet, my design creates a solid foundation for future extension:
  ```python
  # Future enhancement example:
  class PerishableProduct(Product):
      def __init__(self, name, sku, price, quantity, expiry_date):
          super().__init__(name, sku, price, quantity)
          self.expiry_date = expiry_date
          
      def is_expired(self, current_date):
          return current_date > self.expiry_date
  ```

- **Polymorphism:** Methods handle different object types appropriately, enabling code reuse and flexibility:
  ```python
  # The Warehouse class interacts with different objects polymorphically
  def store_product(self, sku, quantity, row, col):
      product = self.products[sku]     # Product object
      location = self.grid[row][col]   # Location object
      
      if not location.add_product(product, quantity):
          return False
      
      product.update_quantity(quantity)
      # ...
  ```

- **Abstraction:** The system hides complex implementation details behind simple interfaces:
  ```python
  # Location class abstracts storage management
  class Location:
      def add_product(self, product, quantity):
          if self.current_stock + quantity > self.capacity:
              return False
          # Complex inventory management hidden from users
          if product.sku in self.inventory:
              self.inventory[product.sku] += quantity
          else:
              self.inventory[product.sku] = quantity  
          self.current_stock += quantity
          return True
  ```

- **Low Coupling, High Cohesion:** Each class has a specific responsibility and minimal dependencies:
  ```python
  # Warehouse manages the grid and product catalog
  # Location manages individual storage spaces
  # Product manages product-specific details
  
  # Example of clean separation of concerns
  def distribute_initial_quantity(self, product):
      for row in self.grid:
          for location in row:
              available_space = location.get_available_capacity()
              if available_space > 0:
                  quantity_to_store = min(quantity_to_distribute, available_space)
                  location.add_product(product, quantity_to_store)
  ```

Overall, OOP principles allowed me to break this complex inventory system into manageable components, each with clear responsibilities. This approach has made the code easier to test and maintain, and provides a robust foundation for adding new features in the future, such as different product types or advanced warehouse visualization.
