# Part D: Evaluate

## User Acceptance Testing
To make sure my system was actually usable, I asked a few classmates and my teacher to try it out. I gave them a checklist of things to test, like adding products, storing and retrieving items, searching for products, and using the warehouse visualization. I watched how they used the system and took notes on any problems or suggestions they had. Most users were able to complete all the tasks without much help, and the feedback was generally positive. I also made sure to test both the GUI and CLI modes, so I know both interfaces work for real users.

## Questionnaire Data

| Question | Response Summary |
|----------|-----------------|
| Was the system easy to use? | Most people found the GUI intuitive, but a few wanted more help prompts. |
| Did all features work as expected? | Yes, everything worked with the test data. |
| Was the warehouse visualization clear? | Yes, the 2D grid made it easy to see what was where. |
| Suggestions for improvement? | Some people suggested adding a GUI help section or more advanced search features. |

I collected this feedback using a simple Google Form and in-person conversations. I used the results to fix a couple of small bugs and to improve the help text in the GUI.

## Developer Retrospective

Looking back, I’m happy with how the project turned out. Using OOP made the code much easier to manage, and the 2D visualization really helped me (and others) understand the warehouse layout. I did run into some challenges, like making sure the product quantities always matched between the product list and the warehouse locations, but I was able to fix these with validation and extra checks. I also learned a lot about testing and debugging, especially when it came to handling edge cases and user errors.

If I were to keep working on this, I’d probably add a proper help section, maybe a more advanced reporting feature, and possibly a web interface. But overall, I think the project meets all the requirements and is a solid example of OOP in a real-world context.
