# Project-One: Warehouse Inventory Management System

## Overview
This project implements an object-oriented inventory management system with 2D array visualization to represent warehouse storage. The system demonstrates practical applications of OOP concepts in a business context.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Create, update, and track products with attributes like name, SKU, price, and quantity
- **Warehouse Visualization**: Represent the warehouse as a 2D grid with visual output
- **Location Management**: Track items at specific coordinates in the warehouse
- **Inventory Operations**: Add, remove, search, and update inventory items
- **Command-line Interface**: Interactive terminal interface for system operation

## System Architecture
The system is designed with modular OOP principles:
- `Product` class: Represents individual products with their attributes
- `Location` class: Represents storage positions in the warehouse grid
- `Warehouse` class: Manages the 2D array of locations and handles operations

## Usage
Run the main program:
```
python main.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to:
- Add/remove products
- Check inventory levels
- Visualize the warehouse layout
- Search for products
- Optimize storage

## Project Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies required
